        <h2>What is 80/20 Learning?</h2>
        <p>
          The 80/20 principle, also known as the Pareto Principle, suggests that
          roughly 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. We apply this to
          learning by identifying and focusing on the most crucial concepts that
          provide the greatest understanding.
