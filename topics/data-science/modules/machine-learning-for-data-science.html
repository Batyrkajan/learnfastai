  <h2>80/20 Study Guide - Key Concepts</h2>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">A type of Machine Learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning the input data is paired with the correct output.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Used for prediction and classification tasks.</li>
        <li>Common algorithms include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees.</li>
        <li>Requires a labeled dataset for training.</li>
        <li>Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Supervised Learning is foundational for solving real-world problems like spam detection, customer churn prediction, and medical diagnosis.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Supervised Learning helps predict outcomes based on labeled data.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">A type of Machine Learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data, identifying patterns and structures without predefined outputs.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Used for clustering and dimensionality reduction.</li>
        <li>Common algorithms include K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).</li>
        <li>Does not require labeled data.</li>
        <li>Evaluated using metrics like silhouette score and inertia.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Unsupervised Learning is essential for discovering hidden patterns in data, such as customer segmentation or anomaly detection.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Unsupervised Learning uncovers hidden structures in unlabeled data.</p>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">The process of assessing the performance of a Machine Learning model using various metrics and techniques.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.</li>
        <li>Cross-validation helps ensure model generalizability.</li>
        <li>Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.</li>
        <li>Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Proper model evaluation ensures that your Machine Learning model is reliable and performs well in real-world scenarios.</p>
