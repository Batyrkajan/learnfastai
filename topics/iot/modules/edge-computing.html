    <h3>What is Edge Computing?</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Edge Computing refers to processing data near the source of data generation (e.g., IoT devices) instead of sending it to a centralized cloud server.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Reduces latency by processing data locally.</li>
        <li>Decreases bandwidth usage by minimizing data sent to the cloud.</li>
