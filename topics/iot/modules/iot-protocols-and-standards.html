  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol designed for low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Uses a publish-subscribe model for communication.</li>
        <li>Designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks.</li>
        <li>Three QoS levels: 0 (at most once), 1 (at least once), and 2 (exactly once).</li>
        <li>Broker-based architecture ensures decoupling of devices.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>MQTT is widely used in IoT for its efficiency and reliability, making it ideal for applications like remote monitoring and industrial automation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>MQTT is the go-to protocol for lightweight, reliable communication in IoT.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">CoAP is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and networks, designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Uses UDP for lightweight communication.</li>
        <li>Supports RESTful architecture, similar to HTTP.</li>
        <li>Includes built-in discovery and multicast support.</li>
        <li>Designed for low-power, low-memory devices.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>CoAP is essential for IoT applications requiring low overhead and efficient communication, such as smart home devices and environmental monitoring.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>CoAP is the lightweight, RESTful protocol for constrained IoT devices.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">HTTP/HTTPS is the foundation of data communication on the web, used for transferring data between IoT devices and servers.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Uses a request-response model.</li>
        <li>HTTPS adds encryption for secure communication.</li>
        <li>Widely supported and easy to implement.</li>
        <li>Higher overhead compared to MQTT and CoAP.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>HTTP/HTTPS is crucial for IoT applications requiring web compatibility and secure data transfer, such as cloud-based IoT platforms.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>HTTP/HTTPS is the standard for web-compatible and secure IoT communication.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Zigbee</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Zigbee is a wireless communication protocol designed for low-power, low-data-rate applications, often used in home automation and industrial IoT.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Operates on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.</li>
        <li>Supports mesh networking for extended range and reliability.</li>
        <li>Low power consumption ideal for battery-operated devices.</li>
        <li>Widely used in smart home devices like lights and sensors.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Zigbee is a cornerstone of IoT ecosystems requiring reliable, low-power communication, such as smart homes and industrial automation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
