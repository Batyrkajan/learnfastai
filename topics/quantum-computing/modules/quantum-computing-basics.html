  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Quantum Bits (Qubits)</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information, analogous to a classical bit but with the ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously due to quantum superposition.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Qubits can be in a state of 0, 1, or any quantum superposition of these states.</li>
        <li>Superposition allows qubits to perform multiple calculations at once.</li>
        <li>Qubits are often implemented using particles like electrons or photons.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Qubits enable quantum computers to solve complex problems exponentially faster than classical computers, making them ideal for tasks like cryptography, optimization, and simulations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Qubits are the building blocks of quantum computing, allowing for parallel processing and solving problems that are impossible for classical computers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Superposition</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Superposition is a quantum principle where a qubit can exist in multiple states at the same time until it is measured.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Superposition enables quantum parallelism, allowing multiple computations simultaneously.</li>
        <li>It is a fundamental property that distinguishes quantum computing from classical computing.</li>
        <li>Measurement collapses the superposition into a single state.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Superposition is the key to quantum speedup, enabling quantum computers to explore many solutions at once, which is critical for solving complex problems efficiently.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Superposition allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of data simultaneously, making them incredibly powerful for specific tasks.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Entanglement</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon where two or more qubits become interconnected, such that the state of one qubit directly influences the state of another, regardless of distance.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Entangled qubits share a single quantum state.</li>
        <li>Changes to one qubit instantly affect its entangled partner.</li>
        <li>Entanglement is essential for quantum communication and error correction.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Entanglement enables quantum computers to perform highly coordinated operations, which is crucial for tasks like secure communication and complex computations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Entanglement connects qubits in a way that allows quantum computers to process information more efficiently than classical systems.</p>
