    <h3>What is Kanban?</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. It uses boards and cards to represent tasks and their progress.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Kanban focuses on visualizing work to identify bottlenecks.</li>
        <li>It limits work-in-progress (WIP) to improve flow.</li>
        <li>It emphasizes continuous improvement through feedback loops.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Kanban helps teams deliver value faster by improving workflow transparency and reducing inefficiencies. It is particularly useful in dynamic environments where priorities change frequently.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Kanban is about visualizing work, limiting WIP, and continuously improving processes.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Kanban Board</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">A Kanban board is a visual tool that represents the workflow, typically divided into columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Columns represent stages of the workflow.</li>
        <li>Cards represent individual tasks or work items.</li>
        <li>The board provides real-time visibility into the status of work.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>The Kanban board helps teams track progress, identify bottlenecks, and ensure smooth workflow management. It fosters collaboration and transparency.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>A Kanban board is a visual representation of your workflow, making it easier to manage and track tasks.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">WIP limits are constraints set on the number of tasks that can be in progress at any given time in a Kanban system.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>WIP limits prevent overloading team members.</li>
        <li>They help identify bottlenecks and improve flow.</li>
        <li>They encourage focus and completion of tasks before starting new ones.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>WIP limits ensure that teams do not take on more work than they can handle, leading to faster delivery and higher-quality outcomes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>WIP limits keep teams focused and prevent overloading, ensuring smoother workflows.</p>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Kaizen is the philosophy of continuous improvement, where teams regularly reflect on their processes and make incremental changes to improve efficiency.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Kaizen encourages small, ongoing changes rather than large overhauls.</li>
        <li>It relies on team feedback and data-driven decisions.</li>
        <li>It fosters a culture of collaboration and learning.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Continuous improvement ensures that teams adapt to changing demands and continuously enhance their workflows, leading to long-term success.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Kaizen is about making small, continuous improvements to processes for better results.</p>
