  <h2>80/20 Study Guide - Key Concepts</h2>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Components</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that return HTML elements.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Components can be functional or class-based.</li>
        <li>Functional components are simpler and use hooks for state management.</li>
        <li>Props are used to pass data between components.</li>
        <li>Components can be nested to create complex UIs.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Components make your code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. They allow you to break down complex UIs into smaller, manageable pieces.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Think of components as LEGO blocks‚Äîcombine them to build your application.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>State and Props</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">State is a built-in React object used to store data that can change over time. Props are read-only attributes passed from a parent component to a child component.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>State is mutable and managed within a component.</li>
        <li>Props are immutable and used to pass data down the component tree.</li>
        <li>Use `useState` hook to manage state in functional components.</li>
        <li>State changes trigger re-renders of the component.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>State and props are fundamental to creating dynamic and interactive applications. They enable components to react to user input and data changes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>State is for internal data, props are for external data.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Hooks</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from functional components.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>`useState` is used to manage state in functional components.</li>
        <li>`useEffect` is used to perform side effects like data fetching.</li>
        <li>Hooks must be used at the top level of a component.</li>
        <li>Custom hooks allow you to reuse logic across components.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Hooks simplify state management and side effects in functional components, making them more powerful and easier to use.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Hooks let you use state and lifecycle features without writing a class.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
