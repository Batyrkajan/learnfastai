  <h2>80/20 Study Guide - Key Concepts</h2>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Security Auditing</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Security auditing is the systematic evaluation of an organization's security policies, procedures, and controls to ensure they are effective and compliant with regulatory standards.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Audits assess compliance with laws, regulations, and internal policies.</li>
        <li>They identify gaps in security controls and recommend improvements.</li>
        <li>Audits are often conducted by internal or external auditors.</li>
        <li>Common frameworks include ISO 27001, NIST, and PCI DSS.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Security audits help organizations identify vulnerabilities, ensure compliance, and build trust with stakeholders by demonstrating a commitment to security.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Audits are like health check-ups for your security systems‚Äîthey ensure everything is working as it should.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Penetration Testing</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Penetration testing, or pen testing, is a simulated cyberattack on a system to identify exploitable vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Pen tests mimic real-world attack scenarios.</li>
        <li>They can be black-box, white-box, or gray-box, depending on the level of information provided to testers.</li>
        <li>Common tools include Metasploit, Nmap, and Burp Suite.</li>
        <li>Results are documented in a detailed report with remediation recommendations.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Penetration testing helps organizations proactively identify and fix vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of data breaches and financial losses.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Pen testing is like a fire drill for your cybersecurity‚Äîit prepares you for real attacks.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Vulnerability Scanning</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Vulnerability scanning is the automated process of identifying security weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Scans are typically automated and performed regularly.</li>
        <li>They identify issues like outdated software, misconfigurations, and missing patches.</li>
        <li>Common tools include Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys.</li>
        <li>Results are prioritized based on severity.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Vulnerability scanning provides a continuous assessment of your security posture, helping you stay ahead of potential threats.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Vulnerability scanning is like a security guard that constantly checks for unlocked doors.</p>
