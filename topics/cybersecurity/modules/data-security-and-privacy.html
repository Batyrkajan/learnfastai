  <h2>80/20 Study Guide - Key Concepts</h2>
  
  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Data Encryption</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Data encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Uses algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman).</li>
        <li>Essential for securing data in transit and at rest.</li>
        <li>Requires encryption keys for encoding and decoding.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted or stolen, it remains unreadable without the proper decryption key, protecting sensitive information from breaches.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Encryption is your first line of defense against data theft.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Access Control</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Access control is a security technique that regulates who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Includes authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (granting permissions).</li>
        <li>Common methods include passwords, biometrics, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).</li>
        <li>Helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Access control ensures that only authorized individuals can access critical systems and data, reducing the risk of insider threats and external attacks.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Limit access to data to only those who need it.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Data Privacy Regulations</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Data privacy regulations are laws designed to protect individuals' personal information and ensure organizations handle data responsibly.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Examples include GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act).</li>
        <li>Require organizations to obtain consent, provide transparency, and secure data.</li>
        <li>Non-compliance can result in hefty fines and reputational damage.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>These regulations protect individuals' rights and hold organizations accountable for how they collect, store, and use personal data.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Follow privacy laws to avoid penalties and build trust.</p>
