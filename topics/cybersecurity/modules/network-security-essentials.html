  <h2>80/20 Study Guide - Key Concepts</h2>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Firewalls</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Acts as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.</li>
        <li>Can be hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both.</li>
        <li>Uses rules to allow or block traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Firewalls are the first line of defense in network security, preventing unauthorized access and protecting sensitive data from cyberattacks.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Firewalls keep your network safe by filtering traffic and blocking threats.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Encryption</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Encryption is the process of converting data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access during transmission or storage.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Uses algorithms to scramble data into unreadable text (ciphertext).</li>
        <li>Requires a key to decrypt and access the original data.</li>
        <li>Common types include AES, RSA, and SSL/TLS.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Encryption ensures data confidentiality and integrity, protecting sensitive information from interception or tampering.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Encryption keeps your data safe by making it unreadable to anyone without the key.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">An IDS is a security tool that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators of potential threats.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Detects anomalies, malware, and unauthorized access attempts.</li>
        <li>Can be signature-based or behavior-based.</li>
        <li>Does not block traffic but provides alerts for further action.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>IDS helps identify and respond to cyber threats in real-time, reducing the risk of data breaches and system compromises.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>IDS acts like a security camera, watching for threats and alerting you when something suspicious happens.</p>
