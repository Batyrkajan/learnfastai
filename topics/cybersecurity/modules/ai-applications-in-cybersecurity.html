  <h2>80/20 Study Guide - Key Concepts</h2>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Threat Detection with AI</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">AI-powered threat detection uses machine learning algorithms to identify and predict potential cyber threats by analyzing patterns in data.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>AI can analyze vast amounts of data in real-time to detect anomalies.</li>
        <li>Machine learning models improve over time by learning from past incidents.</li>
        <li>AI reduces false positives by distinguishing between normal and malicious activities.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Traditional methods struggle to keep up with the volume and complexity of modern cyber threats. AI provides a scalable and efficient solution to detect and mitigate risks proactively.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>AI makes threat detection faster, smarter, and more accurate.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Automated Incident Response</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">AI automates the process of responding to cyber incidents, such as isolating affected systems or blocking malicious traffic, without human intervention.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>AI can respond to threats in milliseconds, reducing damage.</li>
        <li>Automated systems can handle repetitive tasks, freeing up human analysts.</li>
        <li>AI-driven responses are consistent and less prone to human error.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Cyberattacks often happen faster than humans can react. Automated responses ensure immediate action, minimizing the impact of breaches.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>AI acts as a first responder, stopping threats before they escalate.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Behavioral Analysis</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">AI analyzes user and system behavior to identify deviations that may indicate a security breach.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>AI establishes a baseline of normal behavior for users and systems.</li>
        <li>Unusual activities, such as unauthorized access, trigger alerts.</li>
        <li>Behavioral analysis helps detect insider threats and advanced persistent threats (APTs).</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Traditional security tools often miss subtle or sophisticated attacks. Behavioral analysis provides a deeper layer of protection by focusing on actions rather than signatures.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>AI spots suspicious behavior that other tools might overlook.</p>
