  <h2>80/20 Study Guide - Key Concepts</h2>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Indexing</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Indexing is a database optimization technique that improves the speed of data retrieval operations by creating a data structure (index) that allows for faster lookup.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Indexes are created on columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.</li>
        <li>Primary keys are automatically indexed.</li>
        <li>Over-indexing can slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).</li>
        <li>Common types include B-tree, Hash, and Full-text indexes.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Indexing significantly improves query performance, especially in large databases, by reducing the number of rows scanned during data retrieval.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Use indexes wisely to speed up read-heavy operations, but avoid over-indexing to maintain write performance.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Stored Procedures</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Stored procedures are precompiled SQL statements stored in the database that can be executed with a single call, often used to encapsulate complex logic.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Reduce network traffic by executing multiple SQL statements in one call.</li>
        <li>Improve performance by precompiling and caching execution plans.</li>
        <li>Enhance security by restricting direct access to tables.</li>
        <li>Can accept parameters and return results.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Stored procedures streamline database operations, improve security, and reduce redundancy by centralizing business logic within the database.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Use stored procedures to encapsulate and reuse complex SQL logic, improving efficiency and security.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Transactions and ACID Properties</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">A transaction is a sequence of database operations treated as a single unit, ensuring data integrity through ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Atomicity ensures all operations in a transaction succeed or fail together.</li>
        <li>Consistency maintains database rules and constraints.</li>
        <li>Isolation ensures transactions don't interfere with each other.</li>
        <li>Durability guarantees that committed transactions persist even after system failures.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Transactions ensure data integrity and reliability, especially in systems where multiple users or processes interact with the database simultaneously.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Use transactions to ensure data integrity and reliability in multi-step database operations.</p>
      </div>
