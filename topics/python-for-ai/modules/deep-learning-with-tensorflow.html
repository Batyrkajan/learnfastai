    <h3>Neural Networks</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data to make predictions or decisions.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Neural networks consist of input, hidden, and output layers.</li>
        <li>Activation functions like ReLU introduce non-linearity.</li>
        <li>Training involves forward propagation, loss calculation, and backpropagation.</li>
        <li>Optimizers like Adam adjust weights to minimize loss.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>

    <h3>Model Training</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Model training is the process of adjusting a neural network's weights to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual data.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Training requires labeled data (input-output pairs).</li>
        <li>Loss functions measure prediction errors.</li>
        <li>Backpropagation updates weights using gradients.</li>
        <li>Epochs define the number of times the model sees the entire dataset.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Effective training ensures that models generalize well to new, unseen data, making them reliable for real-world applications.</p>
