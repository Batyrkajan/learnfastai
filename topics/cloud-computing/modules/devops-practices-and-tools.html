  <h2>80/20 Study Guide - Key Concepts</h2>
  
  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Continuous Integration (CI)</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Continuous Integration is a DevOps practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Automates code integration and testing.</li>
        <li>Reduces integration issues by catching errors early.</li>
        <li>Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and CircleCI are commonly used.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>CI ensures faster feedback loops, improves code quality, and accelerates the development process, making it essential for agile and cloud-native environments.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>CI helps teams deliver better software faster by automating code integration and testing.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Continuous Deployment (CD)</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Continuous Deployment automates the release of code changes to production after passing automated tests, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Automates deployment pipelines.</li>
        <li>Requires robust testing and monitoring.</li>
        <li>Tools like Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and Spinnaker are popular.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>CD enables faster time-to-market, reduces manual errors, and ensures consistent delivery of features and updates in cloud environments.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>CD automates the release process, making deployments faster and more reliable.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code and automation, rather than manual processes.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Uses tools like Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation.</li>
        <li>Ensures consistency and repeatability in infrastructure setup.</li>
        <li>Supports version control and collaboration.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>IaC reduces human error, speeds up infrastructure provisioning, and aligns with DevOps principles of automation and scalability in cloud computing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>IaC makes managing cloud infrastructure easier, faster, and more reliable.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Monitoring and Logging</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Monitoring and logging involve tracking system performance, errors, and user activity to ensure reliability and troubleshoot issues.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack are widely used.</li>
        <li>Provides real-time insights into system health.</li>
        <li>Supports proactive issue resolution.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Effective monitoring and logging are critical for maintaining system reliability, optimizing performance, and ensuring a seamless user experience in cloud environments.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Monitoring and logging help you keep your cloud systems running smoothly and fix issues quickly.</p>
