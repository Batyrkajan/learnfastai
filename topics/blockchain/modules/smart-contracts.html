  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>What Are Smart Contracts?</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Smart contracts are digital agreements that automatically execute and enforce themselves when predefined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Smart contracts are written in code and stored on a blockchain.</li>
        <li>They are immutable, meaning once deployed, they cannot be altered.</li>
        <li>They eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.</li>
        <li>Commonly used in decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, and digital identity.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Smart contracts revolutionize how agreements are made and executed by providing transparency, security, and automation. They are a cornerstone of blockchain technology's potential to disrupt traditional industries.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Smart contracts are like vending machines: you put in the input (conditions), and the output (agreement) is automatically delivered without human intervention.</p>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>How Smart Contracts Work</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Smart contracts operate on blockchain networks, where they are triggered by specific inputs and execute predefined actions when conditions are met.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Smart contracts are deployed on a blockchain, such as Ethereum.</li>
        <li>They use "if-then" logic to execute actions automatically.</li>
        <li>Transactions are verified by the blockchain network, ensuring security and transparency.</li>
        <li>Gas fees are required to execute smart contracts on most blockchains.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Understanding how smart contracts work is essential for leveraging their potential in automating processes, reducing fraud, and creating decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Smart contracts are like digital robots that follow instructions precisely, ensuring agreements are executed fairly and efficiently.</p>
      </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Benefits of Smart Contracts</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Smart contracts offer numerous advantages, including automation, transparency, security, and cost savings.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Automation reduces the need for manual intervention, saving time and resources.</li>
        <li>Transparency ensures all parties can verify the contract's terms and execution.</li>
        <li>Security is enhanced through blockchain's decentralized and immutable nature.</li>
        <li>Cost savings are achieved by eliminating intermediaries and reducing errors.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Smart contracts provide a more efficient and trustworthy way to conduct business, making them a game-changer for industries like finance, real estate, and logistics.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Smart contracts make agreements faster, cheaper, and more reliable by cutting out the middleman.</p>
