  <h2>80/20 Study Guide - Key Concepts</h2>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures security, transparency, and immutability.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Blockchain is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions.</li>
        <li>It is decentralized, meaning no single entity controls it.</li>
        <li>Transactions are verified by network participants (nodes) through consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake.</li>
        <li>Once recorded, data cannot be altered, ensuring immutability.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Blockchain eliminates the need for intermediaries, reduces fraud, and provides a transparent and secure way to record transactions. It is the foundation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Blockchain is a secure, decentralized ledger that records transactions in a way that cannot be altered.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Decentralization</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Decentralization refers to the distribution of control and decision-making across a network rather than being centralized in a single authority.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Decentralization ensures no single point of failure.</li>
        <li>It promotes transparency and trust among participants.</li>
        <li>Decentralized networks are more resistant to censorship and control by any single entity.</li>
        <li>Blockchain achieves decentralization through a peer-to-peer network.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Decentralization is a core principle of blockchain technology, enabling trustless systems where participants do not need to rely on a central authority.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Decentralization means no single entity controls the network, making it more secure and transparent.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Consensus Mechanisms</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Consensus mechanisms are protocols used by blockchain networks to achieve agreement among participants on the validity of transactions.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Proof of Work (PoW) requires participants to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions.</li>
        <li>Proof of Stake (PoS) selects validators based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.</li>
        <li>Consensus mechanisms ensure security and prevent double-spending.</li>
        <li>Different blockchains use different consensus mechanisms based on their goals.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Consensus mechanisms are critical for maintaining the integrity and security of blockchain networks, ensuring that all participants agree on the state of the ledger.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Consensus mechanisms are rules that ensure everyone in the network agrees on the validity of transactions.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
