  <h2>80/20 Study Guide - Key Concepts</h2>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures security, transparency, and immutability.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Blockchain is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions.</li>
        <li>It operates on a peer-to-peer network, eliminating the need for a central authority.</li>
        <li>Data on the blockchain is immutable, meaning it cannot be altered once recorded.</li>
        <li>Consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) validate transactions.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Blockchain technology revolutionizes industries by enabling trustless transactions, reducing fraud, and increasing transparency. It underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and has applications in finance, supply chain, healthcare, and more.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Blockchain is a secure, decentralized way to record and verify transactions without needing a middleman.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Decentralization</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Decentralization refers to the distribution of control and decision-making across a network, rather than relying on a single central authority.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Decentralization eliminates single points of failure, making systems more resilient.</li>
        <li>It promotes transparency and reduces the risk of corruption or manipulation.</li>
        <li>Nodes in a decentralized network work together to validate and record transactions.</li>
        <li>Decentralization is a core principle of blockchain technology.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Decentralization ensures that no single entity has control over the entire system, fostering trust and security in applications like cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Decentralization means power is spread across many participants, making systems more secure and fair.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Consensus Mechanisms</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Consensus mechanisms are protocols used in blockchain networks to achieve agreement among participants on the validity of transactions.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Proof of Work (PoW) requires participants to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions.</li>
        <li>Proof of Stake (PoS) selects validators based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake."</li>
        <li>Consensus ensures that all nodes in the network agree on the state of the blockchain.</li>
        <li>Different mechanisms balance security, scalability, and energy efficiency.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Consensus mechanisms are critical for maintaining the integrity and security of blockchain networks, ensuring that only valid transactions are added to the ledger.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Consensus mechanisms are the rules that keep blockchain networks secure and trustworthy.</p>
