  <h2>80/20 Study Guide - Key Concepts</h2>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Cryptography in Blockchain</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Cryptography is the foundation of blockchain security, using mathematical algorithms to secure data and transactions.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Blockchains use public-key cryptography for secure transactions.</li>
        <li>Hash functions ensure data integrity by creating unique fingerprints for data.</li>
        <li>Digital signatures verify the authenticity of transactions.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Cryptography ensures that blockchain transactions are secure, tamper-proof, and verifiable, which is critical for trust in decentralized systems.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Cryptography keeps blockchain data secure and trustworthy.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Consensus Mechanisms</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Consensus mechanisms are protocols that ensure all participants in a blockchain network agree on the validity of transactions.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are the most common mechanisms.</li>
        <li>PoW requires computational effort, while PoS relies on stake ownership.</li>
        <li>Consensus prevents double-spending and ensures network integrity.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Consensus mechanisms are vital for maintaining trust and security in decentralized networks by preventing malicious activities.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Consensus mechanisms keep the blockchain honest and secure.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Smart Contract Security</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Smart contracts are self-executing programs on the blockchain that automate agreements, but they must be secure to prevent exploits.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to significant financial losses.</li>
        <li>Common issues include reentrancy attacks and integer overflow.</li>
        <li>Auditing and testing are essential for secure smart contracts.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Secure smart contracts are critical for ensuring the reliability and safety of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Smart contracts must be thoroughly tested and audited to prevent vulnerabilities.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>51% Attacks</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">A 51% attack occurs when a single entity gains control of more than 50% of a blockchain's mining power, enabling them to manipulate the network.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>51% attacks can lead to double-spending and transaction reversals.</li>
        <li>Smaller blockchains are more vulnerable to such attacks.</li>
        <li>Decentralization and network size reduce the risk of 51% attacks.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>51% attacks undermine the trust and security of blockchain networks, making them a critical concern for network design.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Preventing 51% attacks requires a decentralized and robust network.</p>
      </div>
