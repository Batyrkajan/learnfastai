  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>What Are Decentralized Applications (DApps)?</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Decentralized Applications (DApps) are applications that run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network, rather than a centralized server. They are open-source, transparent, and operate without a central authority.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>DApps run on blockchain technology, ensuring decentralization.</li>
        <li>They are open-source, meaning anyone can view and contribute to their code.</li>
        <li>DApps use smart contracts to automate processes and enforce rules.</li>
        <li>They are resistant to censorship and downtime due to their decentralized nature.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>DApps represent a shift from centralized control to user empowerment, enabling trustless interactions and reducing reliance on intermediaries. They are foundational to Web3 and the future of the internet.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>DApps are blockchain-based applications that are open, transparent, and decentralized, offering users more control and security.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>How DApps Differ from Traditional Apps</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Unlike traditional applications that rely on centralized servers, DApps operate on decentralized networks, ensuring no single point of failure or control.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Traditional apps are controlled by a single entity, while DApps are community-driven.</li>
        <li>DApps are transparent, with all transactions and data stored on the blockchain.</li>
        <li>They are more secure due to cryptographic principles and decentralization.</li>
        <li>DApps often have native tokens or cryptocurrencies for transactions.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Understanding the differences helps you see the advantages of decentralization, such as enhanced security, transparency, and user autonomy.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>DApps are decentralized, transparent, and secure, unlike traditional apps that rely on centralized control.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Smart Contracts in DApps</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They are the backbone of DApps, automating processes and ensuring trustless execution.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Smart contracts run on blockchain networks like Ethereum.</li>
        <li>They automatically execute when predefined conditions are met.</li>
        <li>Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries.</li>
        <li>They are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered once deployed.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Smart contracts enable trustless, automated transactions, reducing costs and increasing efficiency in DApps.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Smart contracts are automated, immutable agreements that power DApps, ensuring trustless and efficient transactions.</p>
