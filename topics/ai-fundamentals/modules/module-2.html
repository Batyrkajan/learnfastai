          <h3>Introduction to Machine Learning</h3>
          <div class="concept-content">
            <p class="definition">
              Machine learning (ML) is a core part of AI that lets systems learn
              from data and improve over time without being programmed
              step-by-step for every task. Think of it like teaching a computer
              to figure things out by showing it examples, instead of writing
              out every rule.
            </p>

            <div class="why-it-matters">
              <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
              <p>
                Machine learning is what makes AI "smart." It's behind voice
                assistants recognizing your speech, online stores suggesting
                items you'll love, and even self-driving cars navigating roads.
                Understanding ML basics will show you how AI "thinks" and why
                data is so important.

          <h3>What Is Machine Learning?</h3>
          <div class="concept-content">
            <p class="definition">
              ML is a way for computers to learn patterns from data to make
              predictions or decisions. Instead of coding exact rules, the
              system finds patterns in data and uses them to get better.
            </p>

            <div class="ml-process">
              <h4>How Machine Learning Works (In Three Steps)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Step 1: Data Input</strong> ‚Äì Give the system data
                  (e.g., photos of cats and dogs).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Step 2: Learning</strong> ‚Äì The system analyzes the
                  data and builds a model (a "recipe" for spotting patterns).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Step 3: Prediction</strong> ‚Äì The system uses the
                  model to decide on new data (e.g., "this is a cat").
                </li>

        <div class="concept-card">
          <h3>The Three Main Types of Machine Learning</h3>
          <div class="concept-content">
            <div class="ml-types">
              <div class="ml-type">
                <h5>Supervised Learning</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>What It Is:</strong> The system learns from labeled
                    data (data with answers).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Training an AI to spot cats by
                    showing it 1,000 labeled photos ("cat" or "not cat").
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Use Case:</strong> Predicting house prices based on
                    past sales data.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="ml-type">
                <h5>Unsupervised Learning</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>What It Is:</strong> The system gets unlabeled data
                    and finds patterns on its own.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Grouping customers into clusters
                    based on shopping habits, without predefined labels.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Use Case:</strong> Market segmentation (e.g.,
                    spotting "bargain hunters" vs. "luxury shoppers").
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="ml-type">
                <h5>Reinforcement Learning</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>What It Is:</strong> The system learns by trial and
                    error, earning rewards or penalties for actions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Teaching a robot to walk by
                    rewarding steps and "correcting" falls.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Use Case:</strong> Game-playing AI (e.g., AlphaGo
                    mastering the game of Go).
