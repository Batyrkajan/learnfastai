          <div class="concept-content">
            <p class="definition">
              Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that
              focuses on building systems capable of doing tasks that usually
              require human intelligence. These tasks include things like
              learning from experience, solving problems, understanding
              language, or recognizing images.
            </p>

            <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
            <ul class="key-points">
              <li>
                AI is about creating smart systems that mimic human abilities,
                like thinking or seeing, but it's not about making machines that
                "think" like humans.
              </li>
              <li>
                Key abilities of AI include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Learning: Getting better with data or experience</li>
                  <li>Reasoning: Making decisions or figuring things out</li>
                  <li>Problem-solving: Tackling challenges</li>
                  <li>
                    Perception: Sensing the world (e.g., seeing or hearing)
                  </li>
                  <li>Language: Understanding or generating words</li>

          <h3>Machine Learning Basics</h3>
          <div class="concept-content">
            <p class="definition">
              Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on teaching
              computers to learn from data and improve over time without being
              explicitly programmed for every step. Think of it as training a
              system to figure things out on its own by showing it examples.
            </p>

            <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
            <ul class="key-points">
              <li>
                ML powers many AI systems you use every day—like Netflix
                recommendations or spam filters in your email.
              </li>
              <li>
                It's all about patterns: ML looks at data, finds patterns, and
                uses them to make predictions or decisions.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="ml-process">
              <h4>How Does Machine Learning Work?</h4>
              <p>At its core, ML involves three main steps:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Data Input:</strong> You feed the system a bunch of
                  data (e.g., pictures of cats and dogs).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Learning:</strong> The system analyzes the data and
                  builds a model—a kind of "recipe" for recognizing patterns
                  (e.g., "fluffy ears = cat").
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Prediction:</strong> The system uses that model to
                  make decisions on new data (e.g., "this new photo is a cat").
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
              <h4>Real-World Example:</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>Spam Filter:</strong> Your email system learns from
                examples of spam emails (data) to spot patterns (e.g., lots of
                exclamation marks or sketchy links). Then it predicts whether a
                new email is spam or not.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="ml-types">
              <h4>Types of Machine Learning (The Big Three)</h4>

              <div class="ml-type">
                <h5>Supervised Learning</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>What It Is:</strong> The system is trained on
                    labeled data (data with answers provided).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Teaching an AI to recognize cats
                    by showing it 1,000 labeled photos ("cat" or "not cat").
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Use Case:</strong> Predicting house prices based on
                    past sales data.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="ml-type">
                <h5>Unsupervised Learning</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>What It Is:</strong> The system gets unlabeled data
                    and figures out patterns on its own.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Grouping customers into clusters
                    based on shopping habits without telling the AI what the
                    groups mean.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Use Case:</strong> Market segmentation (e.g.,
                    finding "bargain hunters" vs. "luxury shoppers").
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="ml-type">
                <h5>Reinforcement Learning</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>What It Is:</strong> The system learns by trial and
                    error, getting rewards or penalties based on its actions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Training a robot to walk by
                    rewarding it when it takes a step and "punishing" it when it
                    falls.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Use Case:</strong> Game-playing AI (e.g., AlphaGo
                    beating humans at Go).
                  </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="why-it-matters">
              <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>See how AI systems "think" and improve.</li>
                <li>
                  Grasp why data is so important (no data = no learning!).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Appreciate the difference between AI that's trained with help
                  (supervised) and AI that explores on its own (unsupervised).

              <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
              <p>ML = teaching AI to learn from examples, not rules.</p>
              <p>
                It's like training a dog: show it what to do (supervised), let
                it explore (unsupervised), or reward good behavior
                (reinforcement).
