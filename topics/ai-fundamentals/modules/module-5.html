            <p class="definition">
              AI has the potential to do incredible things, but it also comes
              with risks—like bias, privacy concerns, and accountability issues.
              This module will teach you how to think about AI's impact on
              people and society, so you can build systems that are not just
              smart, but also trustworthy and fair.

              <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
              <p>
                AI is already making decisions that affect people's lives—from
                loan approvals to medical diagnoses. If we don't get ethics
                right, AI can amplify inequality, invade privacy, or make
                harmful mistakes. Understanding ethics ensures your AI is a
                force for good.

          <h3>Bias and Fairness</h3>
          <div class="concept-content">
            <p class="definition">
              AI systems can unintentionally perpetuate or amplify biases
              present in the data they're trained on. For example, if a facial
              recognition system is trained mostly on light-skinned faces, it
              might perform poorly on darker-skinned faces.
            </p>

            <div class="why-it-matters">
              <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
              <p>
                Bias can lead to unfair outcomes, like discriminatory hiring
                practices or inaccurate medical diagnoses for certain groups.

              <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
              <p>
                Always check your data for bias and test your model across
                different groups to ensure fairness.

            <p class="definition">
              Many AI models, especially complex ones like deep neural networks,
              are "black boxes"—it's hard to understand how they make decisions.
              But in high-stakes scenarios (like healthcare or criminal
              justice), people need to know why a decision was made.
            </p>

            <div class="why-it-matters">
              <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
              <p>
                If an AI denies someone a loan, they deserve to know the reason.
                Transparency builds trust.

            <div class="simple-takeaway">
              <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
              <p>
                Aim to make your AI's decisions as explainable as possible,
                especially when they impact people's lives.

          <div class="concept-content">
            <p class="definition">
              AI often relies on vast amounts of data, which can include
              sensitive personal information (like health records or financial
              data). Mishandling this data can lead to privacy violations or
              security breaches.

              <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>

                Remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal? Personal data was
                misused for political purposes, showing how easily privacy can
                be compromised.

                Always handle data securely, anonymize it when possible, and
                respect user privacy.

          <div class="concept-content">
            <p class="definition">
              When an AI system makes a mistake, who's responsible? Is it the
              developer, the company, or the AI itself? Clear accountability is
              key to ensuring AI is used ethically.
            </p>

            <div class="why-it-matters">
              <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
              <p>
                Regulations like the EU's AI Act are being developed to set
                standards for high-risk AI applications, ensuring there's
                oversight.

                wrong, and build AI with safety checks in place.

                  Some facial recognition systems have been less accurate for
                  women and people of color because they were trained on biased
                  datasets.

                  If an AI system denies a loan application, the applicant
                  should be able to understand why (e.g., "low credit score" or
                  "high debt").

                AI ethics = making sure AI is fair, transparent, private, and

                Think of it like building a car: it's not enough for it to be
                fast; it also needs seatbelts, brakes, and a clear driver's
                manual.
