          <div class="concept-content">
            <p class="definition">
              In this module, we'll dive into how to assess whether your AI
              model is doing a solid job and how to tweak it to perform even
              better. Think of it like grading a student's test and then helping
              them study smarter for the next one.

              <p>
                Building an AI model is only half the battle. If you don't
                evaluate it properly, you might end up with a model that works
                great on your test data but flops in the real world. This module
                ensures your AI is not just smart, but also reliable and
                effective.

              These are your tools to measure how well your model is performing.

              <div class="ml-type">
                <h5>Accuracy</h5>
                <p>
                  The percentage of correct predictions (e.g., if your model
                  gets 90 out of 100 predictions right, it's 90% accurate).
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="ml-type">
                <h5>Precision</h5>
                <p>
                  How many of the items your model flagged as "positive" are
                  actually positive (e.g., in a spam filter, how many emails
                  flagged as spam really are spam).
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="ml-type">
                <h5>Recall</h5>
                <p>
                  How many of the actual positive items your model caught (e.g.,
                  did it catch all the spam emails, or did some slip through?).

              <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
              <p>
                In cases like medical diagnoses, missing a positive case (low
                recall) can be critical, even if accuracy looks good.

                <p>
                  When your model is too complex and memorizes the training data
                  instead of learning the patterns. It's like a student who
                  memorizes answers but doesn't get the concepts—great on the
                  test, but fails in real life.

                  the data. It's like a student who didn't study enough—poor
                  performance all around.

              Hyperparameters are like the settings on a camera—you adjust them
              to get the best picture. In machine learning, they're the knobs
              you tweak to boost your model's performance (e.g., how fast it
              learns or how complex it is).
