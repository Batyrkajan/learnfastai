  <h2>80/20 Study Guide - Key Concepts</h2>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>What Are Neural Networks?</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons) that process and learn from data.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Neural networks consist of input, hidden, and output layers.</li>
        <li>They use weights and biases to adjust connections between neurons.</li>
        <li>Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the model.</li>
        <li>Training involves forward propagation and backpropagation.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Neural networks power many AI applications, from image recognition to natural language processing. Understanding their structure and function is essential for building and optimizing AI systems.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Neural networks are like digital brains that learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Activation Functions</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Activation functions determine the output of a neuron, introducing non-linearity to the network and enabling it to learn complex patterns.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Common activation functions include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.</li>
        <li>ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency.</li>
        <li>Activation functions help the network model non-linear relationships.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Without activation functions, neural networks would only be able to model linear relationships, severely limiting their capabilities.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Activation functions are the "switches" that decide whether a neuron should fire, enabling the network to learn complex patterns.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Backpropagation</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Backpropagation is the process of adjusting the weights and biases of a neural network by calculating the gradient of the loss function and propagating it backward through the network.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Backpropagation minimizes the error between predicted and actual outputs.</li>
        <li>It uses the chain rule of calculus to compute gradients.</li>
        <li>Optimizers like SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) update weights based on gradients.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Backpropagation is the core mechanism that allows neural networks to learn from data and improve their performance over time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Backpropagation is how neural networks "learn" by adjusting their internal parameters to reduce errors.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
