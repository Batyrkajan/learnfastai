          <div class="concept-content">
            <p class="definition">
              Neural networks are a specific type of machine learning model
              inspired by the human brain. They're designed to recognize
              patterns in data, and when these networks get really complex (with
              many layers), we call it deep learning.
            </p>

            <div class="why-it-matters">
              <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
              <p>
                Neural networks are what allow AI to "see" images, "understand"
                speech, and even generate human-like text. If you've ever
                wondered how your phone recognizes your face or how chatbots
                seem to "get" what you're saying, neural networks are the magic
                behind it.

          <h3>What Is a Neural Network?</h3>
          <div class="concept-content">
            <p class="definition">
              A neural network is a system of interconnected nodes (like neurons
              in the brain) that process data in layers. Each node takes in
              data, does a small calculation, and passes the result to the next
              layer. The network learns by adjusting the connections (weights)
              between nodes based on the data it sees.
            </p>

            <div class="ml-process">
              <h4>How Does a Neural Network Work?</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Input Layer:</strong> Where the data enters (e.g.,
                  pixels of an image).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Hidden Layers:</strong> Where the magic happens‚Äînodes
                  process the data, layer by layer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Output Layer:</strong> Where the final result comes
                  out (e.g., "this is a cat").
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The more hidden layers, the deeper the network, and the more
                complex patterns it can learn.

            <p class="definition">
              Deep learning is just a fancy term for neural networks with many
              hidden layers (hence "deep"). These deep networks can tackle
              really tough problems, like understanding language or recognizing
              faces, because they can learn intricate patterns.

                <strong>Face Recognition:</strong> Your phone uses a neural
                network to recognize your face. It's trained on thousands of
                face images, learning patterns like the distance between eyes or
                the shape of your nose. When you unlock your phone, the network
                checks if the face it sees matches the patterns it learned.
