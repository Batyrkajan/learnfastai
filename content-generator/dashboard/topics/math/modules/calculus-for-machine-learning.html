  <h2>80/20 Study Guide - Key Concepts</h2>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Derivatives</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">A derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes. It represents the slope of the function at a given point.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Derivatives are used to find the rate of change of a function.</li>
        <li>In machine learning, derivatives help optimize models by minimizing loss functions.</li>
        <li>The chain rule is essential for computing gradients in neural networks.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Derivatives are the foundation of gradient-based optimization, which is central to training machine learning models. Without understanding derivatives, you cannot effectively tune models or improve their performance.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Derivatives tell you how to adjust model parameters to reduce errors.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Gradient Descent</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent, as defined by the negative of the gradient.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Gradient descent updates model parameters to minimize the loss function.</li>
        <li>Learning rate controls the size of the steps taken during optimization.</li>
        <li>Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a variant that uses random samples for faster computation.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Gradient descent is the backbone of training most machine learning models, including neural networks. It enables models to learn from data by minimizing errors.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Gradient descent helps models "learn" by adjusting parameters to reduce errors.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept-card">
    <h3>Partial Derivatives</h3>
    <div class="concept-content">
      <p class="definition">A partial derivative measures how a function changes with respect to one of its variables while keeping the others constant.</p>
      
      <h4>The 20% You Need to Know:</h4>
      <ul class="key-points">
        <li>Partial derivatives are used in multivariable functions, common in machine learning.</li>
        <li>They are essential for computing gradients in models with multiple parameters.</li>
        <li>Partial derivatives help understand the impact of individual features on the model's output.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="why-it-matters">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <p>Partial derivatives allow us to optimize models with multiple variables, which is critical for complex machine learning algorithms like deep learning.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="simple-takeaway">
        <h4>Simple Takeaway:</h4>
        <p>Partial derivatives help us understand how each parameter affects the model's performance.</p>
