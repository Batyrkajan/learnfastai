Here’s a quick overview of what we’ll cover:
Introduction to Python for AI: We’ll kick things off with the basics of Python, the most popular language for AI. Think of it as your trusty toolbox—we’ll learn the essentials like variables, loops, and functions.

Key Libraries: Next, we’ll explore powerful tools like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow (or PyTorch) to handle data and build models.

Building Your First Model: You’ll create a simple machine learning model from scratch, like predicting house prices, with a step-by-step guide.

Hands-On Project: We’ll wrap up with a fun mini-project to put your skills to the test.

No prior coding experience? No problem—I’ll explain everything in plain English and guide you every step of the way. Let’s get started with Python basics in the next lesson!
